The blockchain is a **distributed**, trustless store of information. Let's
disect each of these terms one by one. You'll often hear the term "distributed
ledger" used. It is correct in a narrow sense. A ledger is just a KV store from
block number to transactions.

You'll often hear the term "distributed ledger" used. It is correct in a narrow
sense. A ledger is just a KV store from block number to transactions. Take a
look at `uint = 256;`

The blockchain is a distributed, trustless store of information. Let's disect
each of these terms one by one.

You'll often hear the term "distributed ledger" used. It is correct in a narrow

```bash
apt-get update --foo --bar="yowza"
apt-get install bash
```

## So what, g?

```solidity
contract ERC20 is Context, IERC20, IERC20Metadata {
    mapping(address => uint256) private _balances;

    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) private _allowances;

    uint256 private _totalSupply;

    string private _name;
    string private _symbol;

    /**
     * @dev Sets the values for {name} and {symbol}.
     *
     * The default value of {decimals} is 18. To select a different value for
     * {decimals} you should overload it.
     *
     * All two of these values are immutable: they can only be set once during
     * construction.
     */
    constructor(string memory name_, string memory symbol_) {
        _name = name_;
        _symbol = symbol_;
    }

    /**
     * @dev Returns the name of the token.
     */
    function name() public view virtual override returns (string memory) {
        return _name;
    }
}
```

And this is the constructor:

```solidity
constructor(string memory name_, string memory symbol_) {
    _name = name_;
    _symbol = symbol_;
}
```
