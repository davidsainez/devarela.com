The blockchain is a distributed, trustless store of information. Let's disect
each of these terms one by one. You'll often hear the term "distributed ledger"
used. It is correct in a narrow sense. A ledger is just a KV store from block
number to transactions.

look at `uint = 256;`

## What is the Blockchain?

The blockchain is a distributed, trustless store of information. Let's disect
each of these terms one by one.

You'll often hear the term "distributed ledger" used. It is correct in a narrow

```bash
apt-get update --foo --bar="yowza"
apt-get install bash

## So what, g?

```solidity
import styles from './code.module.scss';

const getRawText = (children) => {
  let text = '';

  React.Children.map(children, (child) => {
    if (typeof child === 'string') {
      text += child;
    }
  });

  return text;
};

const Highlight = ({ children }) => {
  return <Refractor language="ts" value={getRawText(children)} />;
};
```

And this is the constructor:

```solidity
constructor(string memory name_, string memory symbol_) {
    _name = name_;
    _symbol = symbol_;
}
```
