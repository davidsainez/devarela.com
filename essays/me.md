summary: A short description of myself
---

I'm David Sainez. I like to create things. Profesionally, I create software.

I taught myself programming as a teenager, discovering the thrill of making code
run. This excitement led me to UC Davis, where I graduated with a degree in
Computer Science. My professional journey includes work with full-stack web
technology.

Together with a team, I co-founded a FinTech startup. This endeavor allowed me
to explore technology, strategy, and communication, teaching me valuable and
pragmatic lessons. Though the experience was arduous, it shaped my understanding
of persistence and resilience.

In the open-source community, I contributed significantly to Julia's package
manager. Collaborating with brilliant minds provided an enriching learning
opportunity, constantly challenging me to grow.

I hold a fundamental belief that people are good, though communication may be
complex and challenging at times.

Outside of programming, my pursuits extend to weightlifting, longevity, hiking,
meditation, math, and metal music.
